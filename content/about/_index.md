## This Blog

I wanted to create a blog where I can explore questions I have and show
how I use data to do so… This is what I came up with.

## Me

I like spending time thinking about the big
picture and then carrying out tasks to make it work. I also don’t 
just accept ideas, but have to compare the evidence for them
against the representation of the world I’ve built. I try to use the
scientific method to do this, but sometimes there are things that just
appeal to me because of how well they fit other concepts I’ve adopted.

I went to high school at the [Illinois Math and Science
Academy](https://www.imsa.edu/), which is a publicly funded residential
school created to help prepare students for STEM degrees. Instead I
choose to study Economics at [Occidental College](http://www.oxy.edu/).

After working as an analyst for several years, I started thinking about what I
wanted to do with my life. I was researching careers and I came across
Data Science. I had never heard of it, but I realized I was already
doing a lot of it. I started to explore machine learning and after
applying to a project at work I realized right away just how powerful of
a tool it was and how much potential it had to reshape the way I tackle
all sorts of problems. I decided then I wanted to devote my career to
this and enrolled in the [MIDS Program through UC
Berkeley](https://datascience.berkeley.edu) and graduated in May 2016.

Since then I've worked for a few #fintech companies in Chicago and working 
on problems like building a data lake and data warehouse from scrath, 
automating direct to consumer marketing initiatives using customer clustering and
event triggers, anomaly detection to identify risky customers based on purchase 
behavior, and forecasting revenue and price elasticity for consumer products.

Outside of work, I'm fairly active in the local R and Python user groups. I have
[some of the talks](https://raybuhr.github.io/talks/) I've given available online.
If you have any questions about them or any of my posts, feel to reach out to me on
Twitter (contact link at the top). Other than data science and technology, 
I'm a huge fan of basketball, especially the NBA, as well as science-fiction.
