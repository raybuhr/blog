<h2>Redesign</h2>
<p>My previous blog design, as last blog post, used Rmarkdown (.Rmd) to create and build out the site. Rmarkdown is a really powerful way to communicate using the tools that R provides, but it is really slow and painful to rebuild every post each time you make a change to the site. Also, while you can always add custom css styling to your site and your Rmarkdown files, I found that it was difficult to not spend countless hours doing so and still end up with something I really liked. Lastly, Rmarkdown websites do not allow for tree based directories, i.e. every post has to be in a flat project directory. This makes it hard to scale out the blog as you add more posts. Since I had in mind keeping this around for a good long while, I wanted to incorporate an automatic filing/archive system based on year/month routing.</p>

<div id="hugo" class="section level2">
<h2>Hugo</h2>
<p>First off, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> is a static website engine written in Go. More importantly, it makes compiling blogs posts written in markdown into rich, feature filled websites really fast and easy. If you just want to write blog posts without using R to create tables and charts or doing any computation, I highly recommend trying out hugo.</p>

<h2>Blogdown</h2>
<p>The good people at RStudio, who created and maintain the Rmarkdown library, also felt the same pain points I did using it to create a static website (static means no server interaction necessary, but includes interactivity through the browser via javascript). Their answer seems to be to use hugo to build and render the website, but use Rmarkdown to generate the html for individual pages and/or blog posts. To do this, the have begun development of the library <code>blogdown</code>, available <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">via github</a>. In addition, there is currently <strong><em>a whole book</em></strong> being written on how to effectively use <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>. From my experience getting this redesign up and running, I totally understand the need for such detailed documentation. Blogdown + hugo + Rmarkdown is a really fantastic tool, but combining all three together was much more challenging than I anticipated.</p>

<div id="lessons-learned" class="section level2">
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>In order to remind future me (since I’m not great at creating posts in a timely manner) and maybe offer some help to others looking to use blogdown, here are some lessons I learned during the redesign of my blog using the aforementioned technology.</p>
<p><strong>Create a blog project directory.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will want to iterate, <strong>a lot</strong>.</li>
<li>You may want to compare different versions of your website at the same time.</li>
<li>Having a folder where you can keep the different versions and tests makes your process (i.e. development cycle) a lot easier.</li>
<li>When you find a test that you start to like, promoting it to your hosting platform becomes much easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try out hugo by itself first.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo is an awesome tool and really simple to get started with, but does not assume you will be using other tooling (like RStudio, Rmarkdown, etc.) to build your site.</li>
<li>Getting the hang of hugo only takes a couple hours.</li>
<li>Getting proficient at tweaking your site until you are finally happy with it takes many hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try out blogdown by itself first.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blogdown is a just light hugo wrapper for R.</li>
<li>Blogdown assumes you have already learned how to use hugo to a minimal degree (the couple hours mentiond I just mentioned).</li>
<li>Blogdown works best <em>after</em> you have already decided which theme you want to use.</li>
<li>Delete the <code>config.yaml</code> file blogdown created. Hugo uses <code>config.toml</code> by default and doesn’t like having multiple config files.</li>
<li>Play with the <code>new_site()</code> parameters.
<ul>
<li>For example, the <code>sample</code> argument will create sample content for you and the <code>theme_example</code> will create content based on whether the theme you pulled in has an <code>example_site</code> directory (most do).</li>
<li>I recommend setting both to <code>TRUE</code> while you are testing out the look/feel of themes, but using neither when you decide on which you want to use.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try lots of themes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read the documention of the theme you want to use in detail.
<ul>
<li>I tried nearly a dozen themes and they all do things similarly, but often times in slightly different ways.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <code>config.toml</code>, like the <code>_site.yml</code> file used for Rmarkdown websites, controls how the website will build. Each theme has recommendations and tweaks to the basic config file so they all end up being a little different.</li>
<li>I recommend using a theme that supports external plugins like Google Analytics and Dsiqus. You can always add custom javascript to your pages, but it’s a lot easier to put your account into the <code>config.toml</code> and be done with it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enjoy (or deal with) searching for help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the sometimes you may need to dig into front-end web stuff a bit to figure out why some complicated thing you are trying to do isn’t working.</li>
<li>Blogdown is still under active development and has some kinks to work out.
<ul>
<li>For example, I learned that using the <code>datatables</code> (DT) library in R installs version of jquery and thus you run into javascript dependncy issues with hugo. The recommended way to solve this currently is to just create that element of your post as a separate page and embed it in an iframe (lame).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="using-github-pages-to-host" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Github Pages to Host</h2>
<p>If you can’t already tell, I host my blog using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. Hugo, and thus blogdown, is not fully supported by Github pages (…yet???). Instead, you’ll need to figure out a way to only include the <code>/public</code> directory in your github pages repository. There are a couple ways you can do this.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Only copy the <code>/public</code> directory to your github repo and include an empty file named <code>.nojekyll</code> to tell github not to use Jekyll and to build your website.</li>
<li>Create a branch just for displaying the website to the public using the reserved name <code>gh-pages</code> <strong>AND</strong> use the <code>git subtree push</code> command to only send the <code>/public</code> directory to that branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>I opted for method 1 for now because it is a lot simpler, but I will eventually move to method 2 so I can have all my code in Github.</p>
<p>More resources on going about with method 2:</p>
